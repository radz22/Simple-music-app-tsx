      lyrics:("Oh yeah, oh yeah  Yeah, ooh, yeah  When a day is said and done In the middle of the night, and you're fast asleep, my love  Stay awake looking at your beauty Telling myself I'm the luckiest man alive 'Cause so many times I was certain You was gonna walk out of my life, life Why you take such a hold of me, girl   When I'm still trying to get my act right?  What is the reason when you really could have any man you want?  I don't see what I have to offer I should've been a season  Guess you could see I had potential  Do you know you're my miracle? (Oh yeah)   I'm like a statue  Stuck staring right at you  Got me frozen in my tracks  So amazed how you take me back  Each and every time our love collapsed Statue Stuck staring right at you So when I'm lost for wordsEvery time I disappoint you It's just 'cause I can't believe That you're so beautiful (Stuck like a statue) Don't wanna lose you, no  (Stuck like a statue)  Ask myself why are you even with me After all the shit I put you through? Why did you make it hard so with me? It's like you're living in an igloo But baby your love is so warm it makes my shield melt down, down And every time we're both at war you make me come around What is the reason when you really could have any man you want? I don't see what I have to offer I should've been a season Guess you could see I had potential  Do you know you're my miracle?  I'm like a statue   Stuck staring right at you  Got me frozen in my tracks  So amazed how you take me back   Each and every time our love collapsed  Statue Stuck staring right at you  So when I'm lost for words  Every time I disappoint you It's just 'cause I can't believe  That you're so beautiful  (Stuck like a statue)  Don't wanna lose you, no   (Stuck like a statue)   And you're so beautiful   (Stuck like a statue) Don't wanna lose you never   (Stuck like a statue)   Oh, no  Every single day of my life, I thank my lucky stars  God really had to spend extra time when he sculpted your heart 'Cause there's no explanation  Can't solve the equation  It's like you love me more than I love myself   I'm like a statue   Stuck staring right at you   Got me frozen in my tracks  So amazed how you take me back  Each and every time our love collapsed  Statue   Stuck staring right at you So when I'm lost for words (Statue) Every time I disappoint you Baby, it's 'cause I can't believe ('Cause you're my statue)  That you're so beautiful (Girl, you are the reason) Stuck like a statue (The reason for living) Don't wanna lose you, no (The reason for breathing Stuck like a statue (You're so beautiful) And you're so beautiful (And I want you to feel it)Stuck like a statue ('Cause so bad I mean it)Don't wanna lose you, no (You're the reason for breathing) Stuck like a statue (You're so beautiful) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah  When the day is said and done In the middle of the night, and you're fast asleep, my love I'm the luckiest man alive")

'Cause it's been three years and six whole months   Since I saw your face that night  It took five seconds to fall in love  And two more to make you mine  Now it's four in the morning, suns set and  Seven minutes with you and it's heaven  Ain't an hour that rolls by  I love you 24-7, 3-6-5  I'll share the last bite of every meal  I'll wipe your tears when you're in your feels  And I'll hold you close through a thunderstorm  When it's cold at night, I'll keep you warm  'Cause I'm fine spending my whole life on everything you like  Is it obvious that all of this is right?  'Cause it's been three years and six whole months  Since I saw your face that night  It took five seconds to fall in love  And two more to make you mine Now it's four in the morning, suns set and  Seven minutes with you and it's heaven Ain't an hour that rolls by  I love you 24-7, 3-6-5  I love you 24-7, 3-6-5 Now it's four in the morning, suns set and  Seven minutes with you and it's heaven   Ain't an hour that rolls byI love you 24-7, 3-6-5"
